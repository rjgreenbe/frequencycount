1. Imperative Case is a linear search which is O(N) in the worst case. There is an optimization (that uses the
fact that array is sorted) that breaks out of the loop if we encounter a number in the array that is greater than the element desired.
In the worst case we will still do N comparisons. For example, when N=4 and entire array is same element, this degenerates
into 4 comparisons.

2. The improved case is the binary search where we have Log2N + C divisions where C is a constant. So,
 in general, for computing the first and last indices, each one is Log2(n) so we have 2Log2(N) as
 follows:
    If Length of array = n
    At 1st recursion, we reduce the size of our active array to n/2
    At 2nd recursion, we reduce the search size of our array = (n⁄2)⁄2 = n⁄4
    and so on...
 Therefore, after Iteration k,
    Length of array = n⁄2^k

 Also, we know that after k divisions, the length of array (cardinality) becomes 1
 Therefore
 Length of array = n⁄2^k = 1
 => n = 2^k
 Applying log function on both sides:
 => log2 (n) = log2 (2^k)
 => log2 (n) = k log2 (2)
Therefore k = log2 (n)
O(log2(N)) for each search.

The following is a snapshot of the data collected from both the iterative and binary search
solutions to this problem.
