1. Iterative Case (in computeLinear()) is to iterate through the array and compute the running frequencies. This
will run in O(N) time as this approach must iterate through the list once to associate the keys with frequencies. Once
the frequencies are computed, the actual lookup of the key in the Map implementation is constant time or O(1). I used a map association between the element and its frequency count to store the associations between the
array elements and their frequency counts.

2. The improved case is the binary search (processBinarySearch) where we have Log2N * C divisions of the array where C is a constant.
So, in general, for computing the first and last indices, each one is Log2(n) so we have 2Log2(N) as
 follows:
    If Length of array = n
    At 1st recursion, we reduce the size of our active array to n/2
    At 2nd recursion, we reduce the search size of our array = (n⁄2)⁄2 = n⁄4
    and so on...
 Therefore, after Iteration k,
    Length of array = n⁄2^k

 Also, we know that after k divisions, the length of array (cardinality) becomes 1
 Therefore
 Length of array = n⁄2^k = 1
 => n = 2^k
 Applying log function on both sides:
 => log2 (n) = log2 (2^k)
 => log2 (n) = k log2 (2)
Therefore k = log2(n)
O(log2(N)) for each search.

The following is a snapshot of the data collected from both the iterative and binary search
solutions to this problem.
